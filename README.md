# Setup Guide

This guide is very minimal and contains steps to just get your server and client up and running.
Connecting to the server won't require Fiddler.
However, if you need a more detailed guide and help with the server please refer to GrassCutter's official repository and discord server.

## Main Requirements

- Get [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- Get [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Get game version REL4.6.0 (If you don't have a 4.6.0 client, you can find it here along with the audio files) :

- Make sure to install java and set the environment variables.
- Build the server (refer to "Compile the actual server" in this guide.)
- Get the version.dll file from the Rsa_Patch folder and put it into the game root directory.
- Download the older version of [mihoyonet.dll](https://autopatchhk.yuanshen.com/client_app/download/pc_zip/20231030132335_iOEfPMcbrXpiA8Ca/ScatteredFiles/GenshinImpact_Data/Plugins/mihoyonet.dll) (4.2.0) and replace `GenshinImpact_Data/Plugins/mihoyonet.dll`
- Download the [Resources](https://github.com/Kei-Luna/LunaGC_Resources_4.6.0), make a new folder called `resources` in the downloaded LunaGC folder and then extract the resources in that new folder.
- Set useEncryption, Questing and useInRouting to false (it should be false by default, if not then change it)
- Start the server and the game, make sure to also create an account in the LunaGC console!
- Have fun

## Important!
- If you use cultivation and you know what you are doing please disable the automatically patch RSA option in settings! (I recommend to use NotThorny's Cultivation modification if you really want to use Cultivation) Cultivation will automatically patch the game either with a 4.0 or 4.5 patch which is not good because LunaGC is 4.6. So, uncheck automatically patch RSA in settings and then place the rsa patch dll again in the game folder if Cultivation has gotten rid of it.

### Compile the actual Server

**Sidenote**: Make sure to append the right prefix and suffix based on your operating system (./ for linux | .\ for windows | add .bat for windows systems when compiling server JAR/handbook).

**Requirements**:

[Java Development Kit 17 | JDK](https://oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or higher

- **Sidenote**: Handbook generation may fail on some systems. To disable handbook generation, append `-PskipHandbook=1` to the `gradlew jar` command.

- **For Windows**:
```shell
.\gradlew.bat
.\gradlew.bat jar
```
*If you are wondering, the first command is to set up the environment while the 2nd one is for building the server JAR file.*

- **For Linux**:
```bash
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew jar
```
*If you are wondering, the first command is to make the file executeable and for the rest refer to the windows explanation.*

### You can find the output JAR in the project root folder.

### Manually compile the handbook
```shell
./gradlew generateHandbook
```

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure to set useEncryption and useInRouting both to false otherwise you might encounter errors.
- To use windy make sure that you put your luac files in C:\Windy (make the folder if it doesnt exist)
- If you get an error related to MongoDB connection timeout, check if the mongodb service is running. On windows: Press windows key and r then type `services.msc`, look for mongodb server and if it's not started then start it by right clicking on it and start. On linux, you can do `systemctl status mongod` to see if it's running, if it isn't then type `systemctl start mongod`. However, if you get error 14 on linux change the owner of the mongodb folder and the .sock file (`sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb` and `sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock` then try to start the service again.)


## Handmade Handbook (tested)
- Create accounts: /account <username>
- Get all achievements: /am grantall
- God mode: /prop god 1
- Enter a domain: /dungeon <ID>
- Unlimited stamina: /prop ns 0
- Unlimited energy: /prop UnlimitedEnergy 1
- Recharge energy: /er
- Get rid of that damn fog: /NoFog on|off
- Set constellation for selected character: /setConst <number 1 to 6>
- Get rid of the skill cooldown: /stat cdr 99
- Change weather: /weather <sunny/rain/cloudy/thunderstorm/snow/mist>
- Change talent for selected character: /talent <n/e/q/all> <level> (n - normal attack only) (e - skill only) (q - burst only)
- Give items: /g <itemId|avatarId|all|weapons|mats|avatars> [lv<number>] [r<refinement number>] [x<amount>] [c<constellation number>] [sl<skilllevel>]
- Unlock all: /unlockall
- Change world level: /prop wl <number>
- Change AR: /prop player_level <number between 1 and 60>
- Change the game speed: /gamespeed <0.1|0.2|0.5|0.75|1.0|1.5|2.0|3.0>
### Make sure to not include <> or [] in the commands! The stuff in <> means its required and the stuff in [] means its not required.
### How to get all of the stuff maxed out: /g all lv90 r5 c6 c6 sl10 | Then do a separate one for the materials: /g mats x99999
### Ways to TP around the map:

Method 1:

- 1: Unlock the map: /prop um 1
- 2: Open the map
- 3: Use the waypoints

Method 2:

- 1: Open the map
- 2: Place a fishing rod marker (the last one) where you want to teleport and mark it.
### How to get avatar/entity/material etc. IDs?
- Go to [ambr.top](https://ambr.top)
- Search up the material/avatar/enemy and then the ID of it should be in the URL of the site, for example I searched for the pyro hilichurl archer; the link for it is ambr.top/en/archive/monster/21010501/pyro-hilichurl-shooter so the ID for it will be 21010501.

## Tips
- Don't do quests
- Serenitea pot is bugged
